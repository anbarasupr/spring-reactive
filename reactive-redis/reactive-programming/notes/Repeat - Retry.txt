Repeat & Retry:

Type and its behaviour:
----------------------------------------------------
repeat		-	Resubscribe after complete signal
retry		-	Resubscribe after error signal



repeat
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

repeat(2): Flux<Integer> reactor.core.publisher.Flux.repeat(long numRepeat)
	Repeatedly subscribe to the source numRepeat times. This results in numRepeat + 1 total subscriptions to the original source. 
	As a consequence,using 0 plays the original sequence once. 

	Parameters: numRepeat the number of times to re-subscribe on onComplete (positive, or 0 for original sequence only)
	Repeatedly subscribe to the source if the predicate returns true after completion of the previous subscription.
	
	After first time complete, repeat will execute the pipeline again 2 more times
	
	when first time completes, the complete signal not even went to the subscriber and repeat will consume it and resubscribe again 2 more times and ake the source emit data again
    and executes the pipe lines 2 mores times. after executing 3 times only, the complete signal reaches the subscriber


repeat():	Flux<Integer> reactor.core.publisher.Flux.repeat()
	Repeatedly and indefinitely subscribe to the source upon completion of the previous subscription


repeat: Flux<Integer> reactor.core.publisher.Flux.repeat(BooleanSupplier predicate)
	Repeatedly subscribe to the source if the predicate returns true after completion of the previous subscription. 

	Parameters:predicate the boolean to evaluate on onComplete.
	


retry:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
retry():	Flux<Integer> reactor.core.publisher.Flux.retry()
	Re-subscribes to this Flux sequence if it signals any error, indefinitely



retry(2):	Flux<Integer> reactor.core.publisher.Flux.retry(long numRetries)
	Re-subscribes to this Flux sequence if it signals any error, for a fixed number of times. 

	Note that passing Long.MAX_VALUE is treated as infinite retry. 


retryWhen(Retry.fixedDelay(2, Duration.ofSeconds(3)))
	retry 2 times after delay of seconds
