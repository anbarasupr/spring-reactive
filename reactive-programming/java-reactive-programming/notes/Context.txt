Context:
	Consider a bookservice exposing api via httpservice. A get method to get the book details.
	The api endpoint is restricted to add security to allow only the authenticated users.
	In this case, we will be using http header to provide additional information like cookie
	Headers are simple  key value pairs like map
	
	Context are also like http headers as map to provide additional information about the request.
	Context are set by downstream and can be view/update only by upstream and not view by his downstream who is created the context.
	Context are thread safe by default and immutable. When context update happens,  a new instance is created.
